				<h1>The Authority of Government over an Individual</h1>
				<hr class="wow zoomIn">
				<h3>While America is by no means even comparable to the government of North Korea or another Communist/Socialist country, it still has a decent authority level on individuals. There are many laws set regarding business, finance, and punishments, as outlined in the Bill of Rights and Constitution. The powers are also divided between State and Nation, but Nation always has supreme authority over the state, as defined by the 9th amendment. Another effect on an individual is Presidential Pardons - if the President pardons you for a crime, you are automatically free. You also get the benefit of the doubt in a courtroom through a writ of habeas corpus, Latin for "you may have the body". Lastly, the government can enforce strict rules upon you if necessary, as seen in the PATRIOT Act, where the Government can monitor all your internet activity to protect against terrorism. <a href="http://www.usa.gov/Topics/Graphics.shtml">View a photo gallery on the Government!</a><br><br><a href="http://www.usa.gov/Topics/Graphics-State.shtml">View another photo gallery!</a><br><br><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/colinlieu/government-slideshow">Here's a slideshow on Government</a><br><br><a href="https://www.teachervision.com/powerpoint/lesson-plan/57025.html">Here's another slideshow!</a></h3>
